# Home Server Security and Infrastructure Improvements

This document outlines a comprehensive set of improvements identified for the home server project, categorized by priority and with detailed implementation steps.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Security Issues (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. HTTPS/TLS Configuration
**Issue**: Application runs on HTTP, exposing all traffic including authentication tokens  
**Risk**: High - Man-in-the-middle attacks, credential theft

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add SSL/TLS termination to nginx reverse proxy
- [ ] Configure Let's Encrypt automatic certificate renewal
- [ ] Force HTTPS redirects (HTTP â†’ HTTPS)
- [ ] Update CORS configuration for HTTPS origins
- [ ] Update frontend API URLs to use HTTPS

### 2. Weak Secret Management
**Issue**: `.secrets.example` contains weak default passwords, JWT secret is visible  
**Risk**: High - System compromise if defaults are used

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Strengthen password generation in `setup-secrets.sh`
- [ ] Add password complexity requirements (min 32 chars, symbols, numbers)
- [ ] Implement proper secret rotation mechanism
- [ ] Add secret validation in startup scripts
- [ ] Create secure backup/restore for secrets

### 3. Missing Security Headers
**Issue**: No security headers configured  
**Risk**: Medium - XSS, clickjacking, content injection attacks

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- [ ] Configure CSP (Content Security Policy)
- [ ] Add X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- [ ] Set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [ ] Configure X-XSS-Protection
- [ ] Add Referrer-Policy header

### 4. Inadequate Rate Limiting
**Issue**: No rate limiting on authentication endpoints  
**Risk**: Medium - Brute force attacks, DoS

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement Redis-based rate limiting
- [ ] Add per-IP rate limits for auth endpoints
- [ ] Configure sliding window rate limiting
- [ ] Add progressive delays for failed attempts
- [ ] Create rate limit monitoring/alerting

### 5. Database Security Gaps
**Issue**: Default MySQL configuration, potential SQL injection vectors  
**Risk**: Medium-High - Data breach, system compromise

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Harden MySQL configuration (disable remote root, remove test DBs)
- [ ] Implement database connection encryption
- [ ] Add prepared statement enforcement
- [ ] Configure database audit logging
- [ ] Set up database backup encryption

## ðŸŸ¡ Important Infrastructure Improvements

### 6. Container Security Hardening
**Issue**: Containers run as root, no security scanning  
**Risk**: Medium - Container escape, privilege escalation

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Run containers as non-root users
- [ ] Add security contexts in Docker Compose
- [ ] Implement image vulnerability scanning in CI
- [ ] Add container resource limits
- [ ] Configure AppArmor/SELinux profiles

### 7. Monitoring and Alerting System
**Issue**: Basic monitoring, no alerting for security events  
**Risk**: Medium - Delayed incident response

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Set up Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Configure Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Add alert rules for security events
- [ ] Implement log aggregation (ELK stack)
- [ ] Create security incident response playbook

### 8. Backup and Disaster Recovery
**Issue**: No automated backup strategy  
**Risk**: High - Data loss in case of failure

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Automate daily database backups
- [ ] Implement off-site backup storage
- [ ] Create disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Test backup restoration process
- [ ] Add backup encryption and integrity checks

### 9. Network Security
**Issue**: No network segmentation, all services on same network  
**Risk**: Medium - Lateral movement in case of compromise

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement Docker network segmentation
- [ ] Configure firewall rules (iptables/ufw)
- [ ] Add VPN for admin access
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection (Fail2Ban)
- [ ] Create network monitoring

### 10. API Security Enhancements
**Issue**: Basic authentication, minimal input validation  
**Risk**: Medium - API abuse, injection attacks

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement API versioning
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Configure API rate limiting per user
- [ ] Add API request/response logging
- [ ] Implement API key management

## ðŸŸ¢ Code Quality and DevOps Improvements

### 11. Enhanced Testing Strategy
**Issue**: Basic test coverage, no security testing  
**Risk**: Low-Medium - Undetected vulnerabilities

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add security-focused integration tests
- [ ] Implement penetration testing automation
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Create performance/load testing
- [ ] Add dependency vulnerability scanning

### 12. CI/CD Security Pipeline
**Issue**: Basic CI, no security checks in pipeline  
**Risk**: Medium - Vulnerable code deployment

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- [ ] Implement DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- [ ] Add dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Configure security gates in pipeline
- [ ] Add automated security regression testing

### 13. Documentation and Compliance
**Issue**: Limited security documentation  
**Risk**: Low - Operational security gaps

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create security operations runbook
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Add compliance checklist (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] Create security audit trail documentation
- [ ] Implement security training materials

### 14. Advanced Authentication Features
**Issue**: Basic JWT implementation, no advanced auth features  
**Risk**: Low-Medium - Account security gaps

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Add OAuth2/OIDC integration
- [ ] Create session management improvements
- [ ] Add account lockout policies
- [ ] Implement password reset security

### 15. Performance and Scalability
**Issue**: No caching, potential performance bottlenecks  
**Risk**: Low - Service availability

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement Redis caching layer
- [ ] Add database query optimization
- [ ] Configure connection pooling
- [ ] Add horizontal scaling support
- [ ] Implement load balancing
