# Development Environment Specifications

This document outlines the specifications of the primary development machine being used for the `home-server` project and notes potential compatibility considerations.

## Primary Development Machine:

*   **Model Name:** MacBook Pro
*   **Model Identifier:** Mac15,6
*   **Model Number:** MRX43SM/A
*   **Chip:** Apple M3 Pro (ARM64 architecture)
*   **Total Number of Cores:** 12 (6 performance and 6 efficiency)
*   **Memory:** 18 GB
*   **System Firmware Version:** 11881.120.116.501.1

## Key Considerations for Docker Development:

*   **Target Architecture:** The home server is planned to run on a Linux server, which will likely be an `amd64` (x86_64) architecture.
*   **Development Architecture:** The development machine is an Apple M3 Pro, which is an `arm64` (aarch64) architecture.
*   **ELF Binary Compatibility:** Direct execution of `amd64` ELF binaries within Docker containers on an `arm64` host might require emulation (e.g., Rosetta 2, which Docker Desktop for Mac often handles transparently) or using multi-platform Docker builds.
*   **Testing:** When building and testing Docker images locally, it's important to be mindful of the target architecture. If pre-compiled binaries are included in the Docker image (e.g., for specific tools or dependencies), they must be compatible with the target Linux `amd64` environment, or multi-arch builds should be considered.
*   **Ollama Installation:** The plan to automatically download and install the official Ollama service binary (Section I of `[home-server-plan.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/home-server-plan.mdc)`) will need to ensure that the correct binary (likely `amd64` for the target server) is fetched and handled appropriately if tested or built on the `arm64` Mac.

This information will help in diagnosing potential issues related to architectural differences during development and testing.
