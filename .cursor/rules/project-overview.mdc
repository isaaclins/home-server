# Home Server PaaS – Project Overview Rule

This repository implements a self-hosted Platform-as-a-Service solution. The canonical source of truth for features, requirements, and hardware assumptions is [project.md](mdc:project.md).

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
1. **User Management**  
   • Admin-provisioned accounts  
   • Forced password change on first login  
   • JWT-based auth & role-based authorization
2. **Ollama Chat Interface**  
   • GPU-accelerated inference (RTX 3060 Ti)  
   • Ships with _no_ default models  
   • Admin-only Model Manager UI for pulling models  
   • Per-user chat history

> When adding code, prioritise these two capabilities before extending to other PaaS features.

## Host Environment Assumptions
• 32 GB DDR5 RAM, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, RTX 3060 Ti GPU  
• Runs on a lightweight Unix-like server OS (Ubuntu Server 22.04, Debian 12, etc.)  
• Designed to deploy under a configurable sub-domain (template: `server.isaaclins.com`).

## Recommended Repository Layout
```
backend/       # Spring Boot services (auth, chat, admin, etc.)
frontend/      # React/Next UI, prefer shadcn/ui components
infra/         # Docker-compose, Traefik, MySQL, Ollama, etc.
scripts/       # Helper CLI or maintenance scripts
```
Feel free to diverge, but keep related code grouped as above for discoverability.

## Resource Quotas (per user, 5-user budget)
• Containers: 2 running  
• RAM: 4 GB  
• Disk: 10 GB  
• Bandwidth: soft cap 200 GB/mo

These values live in [project.md](mdc:project.md) under "Resource Quotas per Account". Update both the rule and the document if they change.

## Logging & Auditing
Every HTTP request must be logged (user, route, timestamp). The log viewer must be admin-only.

Use this rule to align new code, docs, and discussions with the agreed scope. Update it whenever we collectively change the project's direction.
